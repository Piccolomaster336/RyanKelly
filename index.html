                            <br>
                            My two loves are for video games and music. It's rare to find me spending my free time on anything other than one of those. I enjoy creating and playing both music and video games, and hope to one day make a living off of it. I'd be just as happy making a game as I would be writing its soundtrack.

                    When not playing games, I like to spend my free time listening to and creating music. I use a variety of tools from GarageBand and Logic Pro X to Famitracker and even Audacity to make both arrangements of existing songs and entirely new music.

                            A good portion of the music I've made are arrangements of video game music. This piece is a medley of songs from NES games I used to play on the old system in the basement, created in Logic Pro X. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PiccoloMaster336">More arrangements can be found on my YouTube channel.</a>

                            I also made several arrangements for my college's all-male acappella group, the High C's. I've arranged classics like Isn't She Lovely by Stevie Wonder and Build Me Up Buttercup by The Foundations, as well as lesser known songs like Here We Go by Dispatch, or this one, Spin Me Around by Patent Pending.

                            A song I made in Audacity for my Computer Music class. Every note is made by manipulating a single recording of me blowing into an empty beer bottle, while the percussion comes from modified recordings of me slapping my chest and knee.

                            The first level theme from the side-scrolling beat-em-up Chromatic Lock (C[Lock] for short). We were going with a retro art style, so chiptune music made in Famitracker seemed like a good choice.

                    Sharpeez is a website that's best described as "YouTube for comics". The site offers users the ability to both upload comics and create them on the website itself, while also giving plenty of tools for reading other users' comics and interacting through likes and comments. The biggest assignment I've worked on, Sharpeez was a semester long project for CSE 308: Software Engineering.

                    <br>
                    For this project, we worked in teams of 4, with each team member having a specific role. I was my team's Lead Designer. This meant I had the final say on all aesthetic choices, and most of my work was concerned with the front-end, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
